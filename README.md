# Unit 1 â€“ Excel Homework, Kickstart My Chart

The objective of this project is to use conditional formatting, formulas, pivot tables, and pivot charts in Excel to modify and analyze the data of 4,000 past Kickstarter projects to uncover potential market trends. Since Kickstarter is a crowdfunding service, the Excel spreadsheet includes information such as funding goal, percent funded, average donation, currency, country, and category.
